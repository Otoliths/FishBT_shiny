### Summary

Biogeochemical tags (microchemical/bulk element and isotopic elements) is a useful tool tracking fish globally. This site provides a comprehensive database of peer-reviewed literature available on global trends in migratory fish tracking with biogeochemical approaches. These studies have been compiled through an extensive, systematic primary literature review to identify peer-reviewed journal publications and documented examples of biogeochemical tags on migratory fish globally. From this standardized database of existing literature, which make it easy for researchers and managers to query taxonomic groups, migration categories, tags type, elements, tissues, or geographic locations to obtain summary information on the application of biogeochemical tags. Additionally, the *FishBT* database is updatable and provides access to comprehensive published information to inform the conservation and management of migratory fishes.
